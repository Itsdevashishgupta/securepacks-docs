import Link from '/src/components/Linking.tsx';


In the intricate web of software supply chains, visibility is paramount to ensuring security and compliance. Enter Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), a foundational component of containerization workflows, illuminating the provenance and composition of container images. 

SBOM provides a comprehensive inventory of software components and their dependencies, facilitating transparency and traceability throughout the software supply chain. By cataloging this information, organizations gain insights into potential vulnerabilities and licensing obligations, mitigating risks and ensuring regulatory compliance. 

Furthermore, SBOM integrates seamlessly with tools like Grype, enabling automated vulnerability analysis and risk assessment. This synergy empowers organizations to proactively address security concerns and maintain the integrity of their containerized applications. 

In essence, SBOM serves as a cornerstone of trust in containerization, empowering organizations to navigate the complexities of software supply chains with confidence and clarity. 

SBOM integrates with <Link/> and Syft, enabling automated vulnerability analysis. Syft, an open-source tool by Anchore, offers deep inspection of container images, empowering organizations to proactively address security issues.
